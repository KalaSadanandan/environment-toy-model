# A toy model of the environment

## Overview

This is a toy model of the environment.
The source code could be run and test in both sbt console and eclipse-scala.

## Getting Started

Create a toy model of the environment (taking into account things like atmosphere, topography,
geography, oceanography, or similar) that evolves over time. Then take measurements at various
locations (ie weather stations).
where temperature is in Â°C, pressure in hPa, and relative humidity as a %. 

## For Test Editors

The test is designed to be relatively realistic in a variety of ways.  
You could run the test in 2 ways:
1. sbt test
2. Eclipse-Scala
